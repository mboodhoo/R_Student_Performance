# Student Performance Analysis

We will be analyzing the following Kaggle dataset: \
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhil7280/student-performance-multiple-linear-regression/data

The above dataset contains the following variables: \
**Dependent**: Performance Index \
**Independent**: Hours Studied,	Previous Scores,	Extracurricular Activities,	Sleep Hours,	Sample Question Papers Practiced

Our goal is to determine a model that accurately fits and predicts the performance index given the independent variables in the dataset. 

We will approach this in the following steps:

1. Clean the data
2. Split into training and test sets
3. Explore the data
4. Fit regression models 
5. Residual Diagnostics
6. Assess predictive accuracy
7. Obtain prediction interval given new data using best model
